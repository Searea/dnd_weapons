# Monster Action in Combat

By default Monsters follow the same rules as players in combat. However the following options help the DM vary the feeling of a monster or encounter.



## Big Monsters

## One Monster, Many turns

 > The usual problem with big monsters is they get way less actions than the players, resulting in stale, repetitive gameplay.

Most large monsters get multiple attacks, if such a creature uses full-attack (or gains extra attacks for anyy other reason) break them up. Even if it was going to attack one character the entire turn, spreading the attacks out lets players react better.

Group similar attacks: (Claws, Bite, Wings) or (Left Side weapons, Right Side weapons) or (natural weapons, innate spells-like attacks) and let each of those groups act on an initiative. The monster however can use [Reactions](action:reaction) so enemies can't get out of reach of a Full-Attack.


## One Monster, many bodies

 > Another common problem with big monsters is there is no progress:
 >    The enemy is either dead or alive for the entire encounter
 >
 > Compare to groups of enemies: individuals die as the battle goes on, and the player can choose to prioritize

A large monster can be constructed in parts: (By Body-Part, by Phase). Ideally each part has different results if "killed" (Maimed), and has a clear individual indicator of its health remaining.

The parts can also be used to break the monotony of the action economy, acting as a good divisor of turns. Ideal for creatures similar to Hydras, Chimeras, etc

If the creature has movement, each of these turns can draw from the central pool, offering flexibility of choice.
