## Simultaneous Effects

`Acting Player`: The creature, monster, or affect; whose turn it is when something is being resolved (Referring to the controlling player or DM)

If two or more things happen at the same time on a character or monsterâ€™s turn, the acting player decides the order in which those things happen.

 * If multiple saves are required

Reactions then occur at the instant of specific affect (the one that triggers that reaction)

## Rule Ambiguity (Order of Operations)

When there is ambiguity in units, usually stemming from an imprecise map, or description. The acting player is is given the benefit of the doubt. E.g when playing without a battlemat and attack/charge distances are being calculated

*Defender Chooses*: As a general guideline, whenever the rules don't stipulate an order of operations for special effects (such as spells, special abilities, or saves), you should apply them in the order that's most beneficial to the affected creature. In the case of damage, this typically means applying any damage-reducing effects first, before applying any effects that would increase damage.
