# Flaws & Traits

Flaws are like the flip side of feats. Whereas a feat enables a character to be better than normal at performing a task (or even to do something that normal characters can't), a flaw restricts a character's capabilities or imposes a penalty of some sort.


!spoiler! idea
Each flaw grants you the capability to overcome it, and when you do you gain a bonus feat. To overcome a flaw, you must have it impact the session over and over. (Feel free to speak to the DM afterwards to remind them)

 * Feel free to brainstorm ways for the flaw to come into play during a session (telling your DM), helping the DM give you opportunities

 Personality Flaws: One of the best flaws that should be overcome, player proves they can play such a character first.

## Variant: Ability Flaws

These flaws are tied to your ability scores, and all players *MUST* take them. Each player chooses a flaw from their two lowest scores.

If your ability scores change, you might have overcome your flaws, and can choose more fitting ones.

https://sharpenyourgame.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/flaws-in-role-playing-why-they-suck-and-how-to-do-them-right/





## Character Creation

A player can select up to **two flaws** when creating a character, afterwards changing flaws is hard, and campaign specific (talk to your DM). Each flaw a player takes gives them a **bonus feat**.

A player should choose flaws that are likely to affect their character affecting skills & abilities the character intends to use. Taking a flaw which only affects an unused skill will make the player lose the bonus feat they earned.


Unlike traits, flaws are entirely negative in their impact on a character's capabilities.

### Changing Flaws

Changing a flaw usually involves accepting your new flaw, living with it for a few sessions, then dropping the old flaw (the bonus feat you gained is not affected at any time)





## Flaw Types

Flaws can be categorised into these types, numeric, personality, gameplay, and roleplay. Some flaws will fit multiple categories

### Numeric

A simple flaw affecting the player's stats directly. Most flaws of this nature are well balanced and can be taken without DM approval (assuming all other requirement are met)

!spoiler! design #design-numeric-flaw
Numeric Flaws are generally bigger in magnitude than feats. That's because players always choose flaws that have the least impact on their characters, while taking feats that have the most. For example, while a feat affecting skills grants a +2 bonus on two skills, its counterpart flaw might impose a -4 penalty on two skills.

!endspoiler!


### Personality

Flaws which can dictate an aspect of the player's personality, often affecting attitudes towards others & certain actions.

A Personality flaw requires more care, if a player wishes to take one they must ensure they will still fit with the party. They must also ensure they are capable of playing this personality aspect.


### Gameplay Flaws

Flaws which can be invoked in game, usually by an opponent, or fellow player. These flaws invoke negative effects rarely, and are usually inherent flaws (already come tied to a feat). While an inherent gameplay flaw is balanced, one must still ask permission to take it, as it involves extra work on the DM or other Players to remember and invoke it.


### Roleplay Flaws

Flaws which have a strong world or story effect. These are the rarest flaws, and require strict approval from the DM


### Inherent Flaws

Flaws which are ineherently tied to a bonus feat, these are balanced, and can be taken without approval.S

These follow the philosophy that *Flaws close doors but open windows*, where the penalty and bonus affect similar things, acting more like flavour.

##### Metagame Analysis: Creating Flaws

You can create new flaws, but be careful: Flaws can unbalance your game. When creating flaws, keep a few issues in mind:

* A flaw must have a numeric effect on a character's specific capabilities. Flaws with primarily roleplaying or story effects have unpredictable effects on game balance.
* A flaw must have a meaningful effect regardless of character class or role. That way, a player can't reduce the flaw's importance through multiclassing. For instance, a flaw that only affects spellcasters might seem reasonable-but for nonspellcaster characters, the flaw likely proves meaningless. Even if you restrict the selection of such feats to characters of specific classes, a player can easily select a spellcasting class at 1st level, choose two flaws that apply to spellcasters, gain the bonus feats, multiclass into a nonspellcasting class at 2nd level and thereafter proceed as a primarily nonspellcasting character. The player has sacrificed a level to gain two bonus feats, a tradeoff that appeals to some players.
* Similarly, a flaw that penalizes a character's Charisma based skill checks only has a significant impact on the party spokesperson-the quiet fighter or barbarian likely won't feel any impact from the penalties.
* (#design-numeric-flaw)

Flaws are most often broken dure to the following:

 * Players are rewarder for min-maxing, they can choose where to apply a negative (and choose something they don't care about).
 * Flaws are often purely mechanical, and aren't quite "fun"...  For example, if my flaw is “Mean” (-2 to diplomacy) that just means I get annoyed when I have to make diplomacy rolls; it doesn’t present me with opportunities to revel in my disagreeable nature!

Thus most flaws require DM approval, and *MUST* affect something the player will actually use (or do).

!spoiler! todo

From: http://www.roleplaynexus.com/flaws.html


Aloof [Tragic]
Your manner is cold and unapproachable, distancing you from friends and strangers alike. Your preternatural intelligence lends itself to viewing others as slow-witted and a waste of your precious time.
PRE: INT 19+
You suffer a -10 penalty on all Charisma-related checks.
Allergies
You are afflicted with allergies. These may be something as simple as hay fever, but the reactions to such will result in something like a huge bout of sneezing and gasping, and will cause a temporary loss of 1d6 points of both Strength and Constitution during the fit, as well as making you flat-footed for the duration.
Once per game session, the DM or another player may activate this Flaw to cause such a reaction to occur.

Ambitious
You crave power. Money is nice, but being in charge of other people is your favorite thing. You are likely to be brought down by attempting a risky grab for power and failing.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate this Flaw in order to get you to chase after power, even if the deal you're getting into is risky. In addition, you suffer a -4 penalty to all social related checks involving someone giving you (or attempting to give you) orders.

Amnesia
You are unable to remember anything about your past, yourself, or your family. Your life is a blank slate. However, your past may someday come back to haunt you.
You can take up to 5 other flaws without choosing what they are. The DM will...supply the details; over the course of the campaign, you and your character will slowly discover them.

Arrogant
You firmly believe that you are better than anyone else is. Your ideas are the best, your clothes are the most stylish, and you have to let everyone else know how much better you are.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate this Flaw in order to get you to openly show contempt or disdain for someone else.
In addition, you suffer a -1 penalty to all CHA based checks. Also, all items or services you purchase cost 10% more (reflecting your need to buy only the best).

Bad Reputation
You have a reputation that angers or frightens people. Examples include being unlucky, petty, or cruel. The rep may or may not be accurate, but in either case, word travels faster than you do. You suffer a -4 penalty to all Charisma-based checks. In addition, when checks are made to influence NPC attitudes, you can never attain a rating higher than Friendly, no matter how well you roll or how long you've known someone.

Black Sheep of the Family
You are an outlaw to your own house, and have been disowned by your family in the most extreme cases...in gentler cases, they haven't tossed you out, but life is no picnic. You don't really stand to gain any kind of inheritance, and you usually cannot call on your family for help of any kind. Forgiveness for whatever caused this to happen can be accomplished, but it will take years of hard work.

Blindness
You are completely blind, and fail all rolls that involve vision. You also suffer the normal gaming penalties for blindness. You were born without the capacity to see (whether or not you actually have eyes is up to you), and therefore can never be healed. With the DM's approval, a Wish or Miracle may correct this flaw.

Branded
You have fled your homeland for a crime committed and now have a prominent brand. You may have been a criminal, a slave, or some other such illicit individual. The brand is such that it cannot be easily covered, and a cursory search reveals it each time. Law enforcement agents of any lawful land will immediately take you into custody if they see the mark, for extradition or imprisonment. It is your choice as to whether or not you were falsely accused of the crime.
This flaw may be taken multiple times, each time being branded in a different area...if you really want to be on the Most Wanted of All Time list.

Bravado
You are rash in combat, refusing to show weakness by falling back from your enemies' blows.
You may not gain the benefit of any kind of dodge bonuses to your Armor class. Spells, items, and effects that provide a dodge bonus provide no benefit for you.
In addition, you cannot fight Defensively, nor can you use the Withdraw action during combat.

Breeds Envy [Tragic]
Your phenomenal Charisma or Appearance breeds jealousy and envy wherever you go, spurring resentment in many people.
PRE: CHA or APP 19+
Each time your character uses a skill to interact with an NPC, that individual makes a Will save (DC 10 + your character's level). If the save fails, the NPC reacts to your character with resentment and hostility rather than friendship (automatically Hostile).

Breeds Possessiveness [Tragic]
Your Charisma or Appearance makes you the object of people's desire wherever you travel, tempting others to win your devotion at any cost--even if they have to lock you in a tower or kill your companions in order to persuade you.
PRE: CHA or APP 19+
Each time your character uses a skill to interact with an NPC, that individual makes a Will save (DC 10 + your character's level). If the save fails, the NPC becomes obsessed with winning your character's faithul devotion, no matter the cost. This desire could be romantic in nature, or a simple desire for friendship--one that excludes all others.

Bruise Easily
Each time you take bludgeoning damage, including that from falls, you take an extra point of damage per damage die against you.

Busybody [Tragic]
What is the point of having so much intelligence and stored knowledge if you can't show people the error of their ways?
PRE: INT 19+
Your character is driven to share his expertise with those around him--whether they want it or not. Make a DC 20 Will save when someone is performing a moderately difficult (DC 20 or higher) task. On a failed save, your character is compelled to offer his "advice" to the person performing the task. This distraction increases the task's DC by an amount equal to your character's INT modifier.

Careless
For some reason, people always seem to escape your clutches. You don't understand how that's possible. After all, you throw them into your easily escapable deathtraps before leaving them alone with your bumbling guards while you wander away for no apparent reason.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate this Flaw in order for an NPC or another player to succeed automatically at a skill or ability check during an escape from you, one of your traps, or one of your prisons.
In addition, you suffer a -2 penalty to any checks involving the creation of items or the like, including such things as binding someone with Use Rope. You just can't manage to do a great job at anything.

\ Cautious
You are uneasy engaging in behavior that carries a chance of failure.
You must spend twice as long performing any skill that requires an action. For example, deciphering a page of text would take 2 minutes for you instead of 1, while the Concentration skill is not affected by this flaw as it does not require an action.
In addition, you suffer a -2 penalty on Initiative checks.

Clumsiness
You have the unfortunate habit of dropping things, knocking things over, or tripping.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate this flaw in order to cause your clumsiness to come into effect at a crucial moment, which results in a failed check, attack, or the like.
In addition, you suffer a -2 penalty to all Strength and Dexterity based skill or ability checks at all times.

Colorblind
Though this is a misconception, for game purposes, you see everything in black, white, and shades of gray.

Compulsive Honesty
You cannot tell a lie, nor can you behave in a deceitful fashion. You tend to be blunt rather than tactful, even if it means insulting someone who you and your companions are trying to impress.
If it is a matter of life and death, you may make a Will save (DC 30) to speak or act out a falsehood. However, if successful, you suffer a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks for 1d6 hours due to feelings of guilt.

Cowardly
You have a strong sense of self-preservation. You often hesitate to put yourself at risk, even if there's a good reason to do so. In dangerous circumstances, you are likely to run away.
You automatically fail all saves against Fear effects of any sort. An ability that makes you immune to fear (such as becoming a 3rd level paladin) instead grants you a saving throw, but at a -4 penalty on the save.

Cruel
You have a sadistic streak that causes you to perform acts of cruelty for no good reason. Of course, this doesn't endear you to others. Most times you are prudent enough to carry out your cruelties on those under your thumb, rather than those you see as equals. However, you carry a constant social stigma, as rumors have their way of getting around.
Once per game week, the DM or another player may activate your flaw in order to have an underling of any sort (Follower, Cohort, or Hireling), sick of the treatment he receives at your hands, betray you. The betrayal could be anything from abandonment to a knife in the back (DM's discretion).
In addition, you suffer a -3 penalty to all Charisma-based skill checks.

Curiosity
You're a naturally curious person and you find mysteries of any sort irresistible. In most circumstances, alas, your curiosity overrides your common sense.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate this flaw to force you to investigate something unusual, even if it looks like it might be dangerous.
In addition, you suffer a -2 penalty to checks such as opposed Sense Motive checks when being seduced, being tricked into a trap of some sort, or any similar situation in which your curiousity can be piqued and may outweigh your better judgement.

Daredevil
You only really feel alive when you're staring death in the face.
Your character is addicted to the thrill of death-defying stunts, pushing himsefl to the limit at every available opportunity. Make a DC 25 Will save when your character finds himself in a life-or-death situation--combat, climbing a sheer cliff face, etc. On a failed save, your character chooses the most spectacular--and dangerous--course of action he can take, whether it is necessary or not.

Dark Secret
You have some sort of secret that, if revealed, would make you an outcast amongst your society and companions. While this secret is on your mind at all times, it will come up in game play only once in a while...but when it does, watch out!

Deafness
You cannot hear sound--you can feel the vibrations of very loud noises, nothing more. As you were born without the capacity to hear, this condition cannot be healed by magical means...at least by nothing short of a Miracle or Wish.
In game terms, you suffer the penalties for the Deafened condition at all times. On the upside, there are some specific spells and attack forms which you would suffer no or reduced damage and effects from.

Deep Sleeper
You are only awakened by extremely loud noises, or being physically shaken, prodded, etc. Even when you do wake up, you spend 1d4 rounds able to do nothing other than try to shake the cobwebs away and groggily sit up. During this time, if you need to defend yourself, you are considered automatically flat-footed, despite any feats or class features you may have that would indicate otherwise.

Dependent
You have a ward or charge that depends on you, usually a young child or elderly relative that needs you to provide for them and devote at least part of your time to them. In money terms, this will cost you 10-100 gold a month (or more, depending on the nature of the campaign and your social status. DM's discretion). You may also be required to stay near home often in case you are needed.

Derangement/Insanity
Due to circumstances beyond your control, you are permanently insane. You may have a congenital brain disorder, or perhaps you saw something mortals were never intended to lay eyes upon, and it drove you mad.
Choose a Derangement/Insanity for your character from the lists below. Though the list is by no means exhaustive, the following options are ones that have been presented in game terms and that have definable--and most times numerical--penalties.
Please note that there are some severe insanities presented below that will count as "double", meaning that you can take 1 extra feat for the single severe flaw.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder
The character suffers from a variety of physical and emotional symptoms that can be grouped into certain categories (select a single category).
Motor Tension
Jitteriness, aches, twitches, restlessness, easily startled, easily fatigued, and so on. All attack rolls, Fortitude and Relfex saves, and all checks involving Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution take a -2 penalty.
Autonomic Hyperactivity
Sweating, racing heart, dizziness, clammy hands, flushed or pallid face, rapid pulse and respiration even when at rest, and so on. All attack rolls, saves, and checks take a -2 penalty.
Expectations of Doom
Anxieties, worries, fears, and especially anticipations of misfortune. All attack rolls, saves, and checks take a -2 penalty.
Vigilance
Distraction, inability to focus, insomnia, irritability, impatience. All Will saves and checks involving Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma suffer a -4 penalty.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
This illness manifests in one of two main forms, obsessive thoughts or compulsive actions; some characters exhibit both.
Obsessions
The character cannot help thinking about an idea, image, or impulse incessantly, often involving violence and self-doubt. These ideas are frequently repugnant to the character, but they are so strong that during times of stress (such as combat) she may be unable to concentrate on anything else, even if doing so is necessary for her survival.
In game terms, you constantly suffer a -2 penalty to all Listen and Spot checks, due to the fact that your thoughts are constantly invaded by the object of your obsession. In addition, each time you come into a stressful situation (combat, a much needed skill check, etc, at the DM's discretion), you must make a Will save (DC 15) or be unable to act in response to the stimuli or undertake your task for 1d6 rounds. If you fail the save and are attacked, you are considered flat-footed despite any class features you may have saying otherwise, and you may not initiate any attacks whatsoever of your own. Another save is made at the end of the initial 1d6 rounds of unresponsiveness, and if that is failed, another is made at the appropriate time, and so on and so forth.
Compulsions
The character insists on performing ritual actions, such as touching a doorway at left, right, and top before passing through it. Though she may agree that the actions are senseless, the need to perform them is overpowering and may last for up to 10 rounds (1d10, rolled for each specific instance). Even in times of great stress, the character may ignore her survival in order to perform the actions (Will save DC 30 to ignore the urge for 1 round in such circumstances).
The DM is the final arbiter of what you may choose as your character's compulsion.
Phobia
A character afflicted by a phobia persistently fears a particular object or situation. She realizes that the fear is excessive and irrational, but the fear is disturbing enough that she aviods the stimulus.
A DC 15 Will save is required for a character to be able to force herself into (or remain within) the presence of the object of her phobia, and even then the character takes a -2 morale penalty so long as the object of the fear remains.
You may choose to take a severe phobia, in which case the Will save increases to DC 30, and the morale penalty increases to -4.
Mood Disorders
These disorders affect the victim's attitude and outlook. Mild mood disorders can be almost imperceptable to detect without prolonged contact with an individual, but severe disorders usually have noticeable symptoms. (Choose one of the options below).
Depression
Symptoms of this illness include changes in appetite, weight gain or loss, too much or too little sleep, persistent feeling of tiredness or sluggishness, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt, leading in severe cases to hallucinations, delusions, stupor, or thoughts of suicide. All attack rolls, saves, and checks take a -4 morale penalty. A predisposition to use alcohol or other mood-altering substances in an attempt at self-medication exists.
Mania
The character has a fairly constant euphoric or possibly irritable mood. Symptoms include a general increase in activity, talkativeness, increased self-esteem to the point of delusion, decreased need for sleep, being easily distracted, willingness for dangerous or imprudent activities , delusions, hallucinations, and bizarre behavior. All attack rolls, saves, and checks take a -4 morale penalty. A predisposition to use alcohol or other substances in an attempt at self-medication exists.
Bipolar Mood Disorder
The character oscillates between the mood states mentioned above, sometimes staying in one mood for weeks at a time, sometimes rapidly switching from one to another. Also known as manic depressive.
Personality Disorders
These long-term disorders have almost constant effects on a character's behavior, making it difficult for him to interact with others and often making him unpleasant to be around as well. This is an important point to keep in mind when roleplaying--few players want to spend time with another player character suffering from a personality disorder.
In game terms, the character takes a -4 penalty on all Charisma-based checks. In addition, the attitudes of NPCs the character encounters are shifted in a negative direction. When the table on page 72 of the PHB is used to determine NPC attitudes, the player must make a Charisma check for the character. On a successful check, the attitude of the NPC in question shifts one step towards Hostile; on a failed check, the attitude of the NPC in question shifts two steps toward Hostile.
Personality Disorders are classified in the following categories, though all suffer the same game penalties as described above. Select one option from below as your flaw.
Antisocial
Short-sighted and reckless behavior, habitual liar, confrontational, fails to meet obligations (job, bills, relationships), disregards rights and feelings of others.
Avoidant
Oversensitive to rejection, low self-esteem, socially withdrawn.
Borderline
Rapid mood shifts, impulsive, unable to control temper, chronic boredom.
Compulsive
Perfectionist, authoritarian, indecisive from fear of making mistakes, difficulty expressing emotions.
Dependent
Lacks self-confidence, seeks another to look up to, follow, and subordinate herself to ("codependent").
Histrionic
Overly dramatic, craves attention and excitement, overreacts, displays temper tantrums, may threaten suicide if thwarted.
Narcissistic
Exaggerated sense of self-importance, craves attention and admiration, considers others' rights and feelings as of lesser importance.
Passive-Agressive
Procrastinator, stubborn, intentionally forgetful, deliberately inefficient, sabotages own performance on a regular basis.
Paranoid
Jealous, easily offended, suspicious, humorless, secretive, vigilant, exaggerates magnitude of offenses against oneself, refuses to accept blame.
Schizoid
Emotionally cold, aloof, has few friends, indifferent to praise or criticism.
**Insomniac
You have great difficulty achieving a full and restful sleep. In order to get a full night of rest, you must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save. If you are sleeping and a disturbance wakes you during the night, you must make an additional save (at DC 20) to return to sleep. If you fail the Fortitude save you are Fatigued when you rise in the morning.
If you are Fatigued when you try to sleep, you gain a +2 bonus on your save. If you are Exhausted, you gain a +6 bonus. Comfortable conditions, such as those found in most inns, grant you a +4 bonus on this save. Poor conditions, such as sleeping on the ground or in armor, give you a -4 penalty on this save.
Even if you sleep poorly, you may prepare arcane spells as normal after 8 hours of fitful rest.
Disfigurement
A hideous disfigurement makes you ugly and easy to notice—-and easy to remember. Whatever your particular choice of disfigurment, it has to be something blatantly obvious to a casual glance. In addition, as it is a birth deformity, it cannot be "healed", though you could employ magics to cover it via illusions in some instances, and perhaps utilize high level magics to transform yourself into a more pleasing form for the duration, though you'll always have the lingering fear of it being dispelled.
In game terms, you suffer a -4 penalty to your Appearance score (with a maximum score of 8) and you constantly suffer a penalty equal to your Appearance modifier to any and all Charisma based skill checks due to your repulsiveness.

Dislike of Nobility
You have a dim view of the Nobility, considering them to be little more than bullies, cowards, and thieves with power and wealth. Despite the dislike and distrust, you do not necessarily make your dislike known...along with the dislike comes fear of their power that can be brought against you.
When dealing with others who are obviously nobles (or the fact is pointed out to you), you suffer a -2 penalty to all social related rolls dealing with the person or people in question.
In addition, once per game session (as applicable), the DM or another player can enforce this flaw to make you directly oppose or ignore a request or order given by a noble.

Envious
Everyone else seems to have it better than you do. They have more money, better toys, and a prettier wife. You tend to get envious over the smallest things.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to get you to covet something belonging to someone else. You will summarily attempt to get it for yourself by any means necessary.
In addition, you suffer a -2 penalty to Charisma-based checks due to the constant mutterings and complaints you utter, along with the dirty stares you offer those you deem as better off than yourself.

Extravagant
You enjoy living in the lap of luxury. Ale is never good enough if you can get fine wine instead. You aren't happy with anything less than the finest room in the inn.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to get you to focus on your own comfort instead of your job or plans.
In addition, any equipment or services you purchase cost 20% more than the standard rate for the locale you are currently in. The best of the best always costs more, after all.

Family Curse, Minor
Your family (and now you) has a minor curse. Choose from one of the effects under the Bestow Curse spell. Alternatives may be discussed with the DM, but it should weigh at least as heavily as one of the options for the spell. Removal of such a curse is no simple task, and requires a difficult, dangerous quest or pilgrimage of some sort. A simple Remove Curse spell will not suffice.

Family Curse, Major
Your family (and now you) has a major curse. The curse is severe and could become life threatening. Select one of the options under the Greater Bestow Curse spell. Alternatives may be discussed with the DM, but such options must weigh as heavily upon your character as those under the spell's description. Removal of such a curse is no simple task, and requires a difficult, dangerous quest or pilgrimage of some sort. A simple Remove Curse spell will not suffice.
Take note that this Flaw counts as double, so you may select one bonus Feat for this Flaw alone.

Fanaticism
This can be a substantial disadvantage for a character, though it requires significant roleplaying commitment on the part of the player. The fanaticism can be dedication to a particular cult, religion, or god, or it can be more worldly-based, in the sense of overwhelming loyalty to a state, a military presence, or to a particular leader. Whatever their sources, the different types of fanaticism have several things in common. If a certain code of behavior is called for by the belief, then the character must conform to that behavior--even if it conflicts with the immediate goals of the PC and his companions. While fanaticism is not necessarily evil, it may certainly become tiresome to those who do not share the fanatics beliefs.
Aside from the roleplaying aspects, you suffer a -2 penalty to all social related checks involving those folk who know you, or come to know you. Tiresome indeed.

Fool With Money
Your lifestyle alternates between being fabulously wealthy and totally broke. Each time you get your hands on more than 100 gold pieces, you have the compulsion to spend it as soon as possible. The money is spent on frivolous and extravagant things, and is then gone. You may not put any money in savings, and may not give any money to fellow adventurers or friends (although you may buy them lavish but otherwise useless gifts).
You can give the money to charity, buy things for yourself and friends (nothing outwardly utilitarian or useful such as magic items), gamble it away, or anything else that creatively gets the cash out of your possession...namely getting the finest rooms in the city, eating only the best delicacies, etc.
Note that as you gain in level, the threshold for this feat goes up, by 100 gp per character level (so it would be 100 gp at 1st level, and 2000 gp at 20th level). Certain amounts just wouldn't hold relevance as you progress.

Fragility
Due to a serious vitamin deficiency in your youth (or something similar), your bone structure is unnaturally weak, and you are overly thin.
Subract 1 from the number of hit points you gain at each level. This flaw can reduce the number of hit points you gain to 0, but not below.
In addition, whenever you fail a Fortitude save, you become Fatigued, in addition to whatever other effects you might suffer. This condition lasts until you get 8 hours of complete rest. This applies only once to any given source that requires a Fortitude save. Failing a Fortitude save while Fatigued causes you to become Exhausted.

Glory-Hound
You have an insatiable desire for glorious combat, fighting recklessly to prove yourself.
PRE: Base Attack 1+
You suffer a -2 penalty to AC during combat until you drop an opponent. This penalty does not apply if the combat is against a single opponent.

Greedy
Money makes your eyes light up with joy. The more, the merrier, as long as it spends.
Once per game session, whenever you're divvying up shares of the loot, being offered a hefty bribe, or catching wind of some fabulous treasure, the DM or another player can activate this Flaw to convince you to grab for as much money as possible.
In addition, you suffer a -4 penalty to checks involving haggling of prices and similar situations.

Grudge Keeper
You have an overwhelming need for vengeance and have difficulty letting go of grudges.
If you are damaged in combat, you suffer a -2 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and ability checks until you damage the foe who caused you harm. This penalty does not apply if you cannot discern the source of the damage. This penalty disappears when the combat ends.

Harbinger of Ill Omen
You seem to be cursed to forever bump into a specific person, time and time again. Each time you do, something bad happens not long afterward. This person in no way does this purposefully, it just happens with alarming frequency.
In game terms, this can be reflected through utilizing a specific instance of the Misfortunate flaw when the Harbinger pops up, or simply be some creatively hindering roleplay situation (DM's discretion).

Hedonistic
You love a good time. You party too much, drink too much, and eat too much. You have trouble resisting an invitation to join someone in a drink and sometimes shirk your duty if offered a more enjoyable time elsewhere.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to get you to relax your guard and have a good time.
In addition, you suffer a -4 penalty to any opposed rolls involving seduction of any sort. It's just not in your nature to resist such opportunities.

Hunted
You have been accused of a crime (falsely or not, your choice) and are being actively hunted down for it.

Impious
Gods and Religions do not interest you, and the best they will get from you is lip service. You swear oaths you should not, blaspheme without caring, and are disrespectful to Priests and devout worshippers. You consider organized religion dangerous or foolish, and you make no attempt to hide your feelings.
In game terms, aside from the roleplaying aspects described above, you suffer a -4 penalty to all social based skill checks with anyone that you know to be a devout follower or worshiper of a deity. You may later "buy off" this flaw if some life changing event happens that could change your views on the gods (DM's discretion).

Inattentive
Your mind has a habit of drifting off at inopportune moments. It flits from one thought to the next so fast that you have trouble getting it to concentrate on the here and now. As such, you are particularly unaware of your surroundings.
You suffer a -4 penalty on all Listen, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks. Additionally, your character is always caught flat-footed in the first round of any combat that he does not initiate himself (regardless of class features that may indicate otherwise).

Indecisive
You have been known to hesitate when faced with difficult choices or split-second decisions. If forced to choose between letting a villain escape and rescuing a loved one from being lowered into a snake pit, you're likely to agonize over the situation until something--perhaps a cry for help from your sweetheart--forces your hand.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw during time-sensitive moments in the game to force you to lose any bonuses you have to Initiative.

Intolerance
You have an irrational dislike of a certain thing. It may be an animal, a class of person, a situation, or just about anything at all. You suffer a -4 penalty on all social based rolls and checks involving the object of your dislike.
Note that some dislikes may be too trivial or ridiculous to count--a dislike of Bavarian-crème-filled donuts or mechanical pencils, for example, has no real dramatic value and will not be allowed. The DM is the final arbiter of what you can pick to dislike.
This flaw can be taken multiple times.


Jealous Lover
You left behind a jilted lover or former spouse, and they now seek you, for either revenge or to win you back. They are unusually persistent, and have an annoying habit of showing up at the worst times in the worst places. This may also be taken to give yourself a "wannabe" paramour that is a constant annoyance in your life.
Judgmental
You form opinions quickly and change them very slowly. You also have a tendency to judge people on their appearance. A man dressed as a pirate, no matter how gentlemanly, is a scoundrel and a dog as far as you is concerned. A man covered in mud is a peasant, and a woman wearing revealing clothing is a prostitute.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to get you to jump to conclusions and form an unsubstantiated opinion of someone you've just met. Doing so results in a -6 penalty to any social based skill checks made between you and the subject of your judgemental outburst, and a -4 penalty with any companions and allies of the victim that are present at the time, which lasts until some sort of restitution is made.

Jumps to Conclusions [Tragic]
You did your best, but clearly the door is too warped to open. Better try to find some other way into the room rather than waste more time on futile efforts.
PRE: Wisdom 19+
Your character's keen eye for detail often serves him well in analyzing a problem, but it can also be a hindrance. If your character fails a skill check, he cannot try again until the following day--he concludes that the task is not possible for him to complete and abandons any further effort.

Killing Hands [Tragic]
You only meant to slap some sense into him, not kill him!
PRE: Strength 19+
Your character's strength is so great that is fists strike with the force of a mace or club--even the flat of your sword is as deadly as it's edge. Your character can inflict only lethal damage, regardless of his intent.

Lazy
You will never do any more work than is absolutely necessary. You will rely on your companions to do things such as build campfires, cook, and keep watch throughout the night. Generally, you will neglect details of preparedness in order to grab a few extra minutes of sleep. However, if you really want to do something that does not have a clear and urgent need (such as digging a trench around camp or taking turns at watch in case an attack is made against you), you may make a Will save (DC 25, varies depending on the circumstances). Failure indicates that you think the time would be better spent napping or laying under the shade.
In addition, In addition, you suffer a -2 penalty to any checks involving the creation of items or the like. Doing a great job at anything requires effort, after all.

Lecherous
You have a lusty nature and a tendency to pursue the pleasures of the flesh. A pretty woman or a handsome man (however your tastes run) is an almost irresistible temptation to you.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to convince you to give in to temptation.
In addition to the one automatic instance mentioned above, you always suffer a -2 penalty to opposed checks to keep yourself from being seduced.

Lightweight
You are light for your size.
PRE: CON 13 or lower
You have half the base weight of a normal character of your race. Height and weight modifiers are added normally. You suffer a -4 penalty when making or resisting bull rushes, grapples, overruns, or trip attacks. You gain no attack bonus when you charge, but you do suffer the -2 Armor Class penalty and take double damage from weapons set against charges you make.

Limited Magic Item Use
You have an inherent distrust of magic, or certain aspects of magic. Under normal circumstances, you will not use the chosen items. A Will save (DC 30) may be made to overcome this for a specific instance under extreme duress.
This flaw may be taken multiple times, each time choosing one of the options from the list below :

Potions and Oils
Scrolls
Rings
Rods, Staves, and Wands
Wondrous Items/Miscellaneous Items
Weapons
Armor

Loner
You do not have the ability to summon a familiar or gain an animal companion.
PRE: Ability to summon a familiar or animal companion.
You lose the ability to summon a familiar or gain an animal companion. You never gain the ability to gain a special companion, whether through animal companion, summon familiar, or some other class ability or feat. Possessing multiple classes that would grant you an animal companion or familiar does not negate the effects of this flaw.

Merciful
For a villain, you have a terrible weakness--you don't like to hurt people. Given the choice, you'd rather exile your deposed brother to another country than do him in. Whether this is because you want him to live knowing that you beat him, or whether you just have a small soft spot down in your heart somewhere, the result is the same: your enemies keep coming back again and again.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to stop you from attacking/killing someone, or having a third party do likewise.

Misfortunate
Lucky breaks are something that happen to other people. Your luck isn't terrible; you wouldn't have survived as long as you have if it were. It just isn't very good. Look at it this way: if you need some blind luck to get you out of a sticky situation, expect to be sticking around for a while.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw to cause you to automatically fail a successfully made check of any sort. This does not prevent you from retrying, if such is applicable.

Misled
You don't know that you're a villain. You honestly believe that you are doing the right thing. Sometimes, though, you have your doubts....
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to get you to doubt your actions for one crucial moment (uses up one standard action).

Mute
Your vocal apparatus does not function, and you cannot speak at all. You can communicate only through other means--typically writing or signing. This is due to a birth defect, and therefore cannot be healed by any means short of a Wish or Miracle.

Night Blindness
Your night vision isn't worth squat, due to a physiological deficiency. Double the normal penalties in darkness conditions, and cut your natural Low-Light vision or Darkvision range in half, if applicable.
This is due to a birth defect, and therefore cannot be healed by any means short of a Wish or Miracle.

Nightmares
You experience horrendous nightmares every time you sleep, and memories of them haunt you during your waking hours. Sometimes, the nightmares are so horrific they cause you to effectively lose 1 point on all your ability scores for the following day (and thus have lower modifiers to skills and such...how often is left up to the DM's discretion).

No Retreat
You will never run from combat, no matter the odds. Driven by an unremitting sense of honor, you must always fight as long as someone challenges you. Like the wolf, you win every fight but one, and in that one you die.
In extreme circumstances, you may make a Will Save (DC 30) in order to negate this flaw temporarily. However, if successful, you suffer a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks for 1d6 hours due to feelings of guilt and cowardice.
If for some reason an outside source (such as an ally, or a failed save against a spell or effect) causes you to flee or be pulled out of the fight against your will, you suffer a -2 penalty to all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks for 1 hour.

Obese
Your great bulk can sometimes impede your actions.
You have double the base weight of a normal character of your race. Height and weight modifiers are added normally. You suffer a -4 penalty to any checks made for physical exertion (such as prolonged running), and your Base Speed is reduced by 10.
In addition, you must pay double the cost for armor and clothing that you buy (though not for magical enhancements to such armor).

One Eye
You can't see out of one eye--mainly due to the fact that it's not there. You have no peripheral vision on your blind side, and you suffer a 2 point penalty on all rolls and checks involving vision (including ranged attacks). This is due to a birth defect, and therefore cannot be healed by any means short of a Wish or Miracle.

Overconfident
Nothing is beyond your capabilities. If you wanted, you could defeat the best swordsman in the world; you just haven't had any reason to do so yet. And surely that chasm isn't too wide for you to leap across.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to squash any doubts you may have had about your own capabilities.

Overzealous
You are incapable of having a weak opinion. Everything you believe, you believe as if your life depended on it. Everything you don't believe in, you hate with a passion.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to get you to strongly defend one of your opinions, no matter how inappropriate the time and place, nor what the circumstances of such an outburst may be.
In addition, you suffer a -2 penalty to social checks of any sort, due to your overopinionated personality.

Powerful Enemy
You have an enemy after your hide that is more powerful and influential than you are. They are not necessarily constantly after you, but it's always a threat that causes you to keep an eye over your shoulder. This may be taken more than once, but keep in mind that your life expectancy will become much shorter each time you take this flaw.

Proud
You don't like accepting help from others. If a gift or offer of aid smacks of charity or pity even the slightest bit, you grow indignant and refuse it.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to get you to refuse an offer of aid.

Qualm
Some moral code or emotional unrest causes you to hesitate, and may make you refuse to act, even against your own best interest. Qualms come in many varieties, a few examples of which are detailed below. Even if you use one that is not on the list, the numerical penalty should remain the same or similar to those presented below. Consult the DM for final say on any qualms you take.
Chivalrous Courtesy
You despise raising your hand against creatures of the opposite gender.
You suffer a -4 penalty on attack rolls to hit a creature that you can tell is of the opposite gender.
Code of Arms
Trained to only kill other armed warriors, you hestitate when attacking unarmed opponents.
You suffer a -4 attack penalty on attack rolls made against an enemy not armed with a melee weapon. If the enemy uses a natural attack against you, you may then attack it without penalty.
Honorable Challenge
You only cross arms with foes who willingly engage you.
You suffer a -4 attack penalty on attack rolls against creatures that have not explicitly challenged you or made an attack against you. For the purposes of this flaw, an attack against you includes any action that would end an Invisibility spell.
Honor of the Duel
You strongly believe in one-on-one combat to decide a fight.
You must make a Will save (DC 10 + your character level) to attack a creature in a square threatened by one of its other foes. A successful save allows you to attack such a creature, albeit with a -2 penalty on your attack rolls. A failed save prohibits you from attacking that creature.
Solitary Paragon
You prefer to fight alone.
You gain no benefit from flanking a foe and instead suffer a -4 attack penalty on rolls made against a foe you flank.
Ravenous Appetite [Tragic]
Of course you ate the entire roast. What did they expect you to do? You were starving.
PRE: Strength or Constitution 19+
Your character's powerful physique demands enormous amounts of food to sustain itself, requiring him to eat three times the amount of food as a normal person each day.
CAMPAIGN NOTE: For our characters, who currently start out at 13th level, taking this flaw will reduce your starting funds by 20% to reflect all the money you've had to spend on food thus far in your lifetime.
Reckless
You lack the emotion of fear. Unfortunately, it is often an important cue that keeps men from doing foolhardy things. Sure, you don't flinch at the sight of even the most hideous monster, but neither do you feel the need to run away when outclassed.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to get you to ignore any nagging feelings of worry or hesitation you may have when confronted with a potentially dangerous environment or foe, which forces you to undertake the questionable action or attack an obviously superior foe.
In addition, as you tend to move brashly about in combat without careful consideration of your foes, you suffer a -4 penalty to your Armor Class against all attacks of opportunity.

Righteous
The end justifies the means. You are willing to perform morally repugnant actions in order to achieve noble goals. Unfortunately, this can alienate those people who might support your cause if you didn't use such heavy-handed methods.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to dispel any doubts you might have about the moral justifiability of your actions. This includes, but is not limited to, overriding any Qualms (as per the flaw) that you may have, and forcing you to act against your alignment.


Scheming
You like big, complicated plots, the more the convoluted, the better. In fact, sometimes your schemes are so hard to grasp that your minions screw them up entirely. It's so hard to find good help these days.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to prevent you from doing things the easy way. It's not enough to kill an enemy; you have to lower him into a deadly maze, complete with lethal traps.
Scornful Demeanor [Tragic]
Idiots. No matter where you go you're surrounded by idiots, weaklings, and fools.
PRE: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, or Wisdom 19+
Your character has such superior inherent ability that he is impatient and scornful of thos less capable. He cannot help but let his disdain seep into his every word and deed. Make a DC 25 Will save when your character uses a skill to communicate with someone (e.g. Bluff, Diplomacy, etc). If the save fails, the GM treats the attempt as an Intimidate check, regardless of your character's actual intention.

Shaky
Whether from damage to your nerves, or simply having a constant nervous streak, your hands tend to tremble at all times. In game terms, this causes you to suffer a -6 penalty on all ranged attack rolls.

Short Attention Span
You have little patience, causing you to have difficulty concentrating on repetitive tasks.
You suffer a -2 penalty on all skill checks made to retry an action that you previously failed. This penalty is cumulative, increasing by -2 for every failed attempt. In addition, you may not take 20 on any skill checks.

Short Temper
You become angry and flustered under stressful circumstances.
If your character is frustrated, injured, or subjected to ridicule (DM's discretion), you must make a DC 20 Will save or become enraged. While enraged, you suffer a -2 penalty to your Armor Class and you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration
You cannot cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, spell trigger, or spell completion to function. You can use any feat you possess except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats.
This enraged state lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3+ your CON modifier and cannot be ended prematurely. This penalty stacks with those from the use of the barbarian rage ability.

Short Winded
You have limited stamina and you easily become exhausted by physical tasks.
PRE: Constitution 13 or lower
Whenever you make a Strength check, a Constitution check to continue running, or use the skills Climb, Jump, or Swim, you must make a Fortitude save at the same DC as the skill or ability check. If you fail this save, you become Fatigued. If you are already Fatigued, you instead become Exhausted.

Shy
You are distinctly ill at ease when dealing with people, and you try to avoid social situations whenever possible. All rolls concerned with social dealings are made with a -4 penalty, and any roll your character makes while being the center of attention is made at a -8 penalty. Don't expect to make any public speeches.

Slow
Due to a birth defect of some sort, usually in the form of a lame leg or legs, you move exceptionally slowly. Your base land speed is halved (round down to the nearest 5 foot interval).
As you were born this way, it cannot be healed by any means short of a Wish or Miracle.

Slow Healing
You do not heal quickly.
PRE: CON 13 or lower
You do not normally recover hit points or temporary ability damage through natural healing. If you undergo complete bed rest for a full day, you may recover either 1 hit point or 1 point of temporary ability damage.
In addition, any conjuration (healing) spell cast upon you only works at half it's caster level. For example, a Cure Moderate Wounds cast on you by an 8th level cleric would only heal 2d8+4 points of damage, instead of 2d8+8.

Squeamish
You don't want anyone's blood on your hands. It's perfectly okay to get blood on your underling's hands, but you don't like to do the deed yourself. Of course, you don't always follow up on things to make sure the job actually gets done--after all, the sight of blood has always disturbed you.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to get you to pawn off the task of killing someone on a minion, then leave before the deed is actually done.

Star-crossed
You keep falling in love with the wrong people. You're the common soldier who falls in love with the king's daughter at first sight, or the hero who falls for the villain's daughter without knowing who she is.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to shoot you with cupid's arrow yet again. This tends to leave a trail of broken hearts in your wake, not to mention a retinue of angered and concerned third parties.

Stubby Fingers
You have short, stubby fingers which are not well suited for grasping.
You suffer a -4 penalty on all attack rolls made when you use a light or one-handed weapon (natural weapons do not incur this penalty). In addition, you suffer a -4 penalty on all Disable Device, Open Lock, Sleight of Hand, and Use Rope checks.
As you were born this way, it cannot be healed by any means short of a Wish or Miracle.

Stubborn
You don't change your mind very often, if at all. Once you've decided on a course of action, you follow through no matter what. Attempts to convince you that you are wrong roll off your back with no effect.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to prevent you from changing your mind.
In addition, you suffer a -4 penalty on social interactions dealing with haggling or bargaining of any sort. When you want a certain price, you don't tend to be willing to sway on it.

Talkative
You have a problem keeping your plans to yourself. Your ideas are simply so clever that you tell them to other people, so that you can watch their astonishment creep across their faces just before they tell you just how smart you are. The DM can activate your flaw in order to get you to reveal your evil scheme to the wrong people. There's nothing to prevent you from dropping them into a deathtrap afterwards, but should they survive, then you've got problems.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to get you to tell them your evil scheme.

Tongue-Tied
This disadvantage comes up whenever you try to discuss anything of importance and relay pressing information and such. You have the tendency to incorrectly state facts, forget or mix up names, and generally say the wrong thing. At DM's discretion, you can suffer a -4 penalty on social interactions.

Trusting
You don't like to believe that other people are capable of misleading and lying to you. After all, people are basically good, right?.
Once per game session, the DM or another player can activate your Flaw in order to quell any doubts you may have about another person. In addition, anyone attempting to persuade you via the Bluff or Diplomacy skill gains a +4 bonus to the attempt.

Unreactive
You are particularly slow at reacting to danger and other stimuli. As such, you suffer a -6 penalty on all Initiative checks.

Vulnerable
You are not very good at defending yourself and moving out of harm's way. In game terms, you suffer a constant -4 penalty to your Armor Class and to all Reflex saves.
