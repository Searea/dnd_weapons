# Actions in Combat


## Readying an action

Readying an action you cannot use is allowed (as you might be able to use it once the moment occurs)

 * If you ready an action theres an implicit "If I'm able" so if something happens that means you can no longer use your action... you lose it

Readying a spell: Normally this isn't an exception, but as part of the "casters have a chance for being interrupted initiative..."

 * FROM 5e "When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy...""
 *   Thus you would need to be able to cast the spell as you ready (and other creatures can tell you did so)
 *   "holding onto the spellâ€™s magic requires concentration"
 *   If you don't use the action... you would then still be concentrating on this spell... allowing you to use it in a later ready, or as a normal cast. BUT it continues taking up the concentration slot until you do
