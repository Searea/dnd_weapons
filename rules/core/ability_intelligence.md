# Intelligence {#int}

Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This ability is important for wizards because it affects their spellcasting ability in many ways.
Intelligence is all higher cognitive thinking and all conscious knowledge. Worldly knowledge, booksmarts, are all just different expressions of intelligence.

* Creatures of animal-level instinct have Intelligence scores of 1 or 2.
* Semi-Intelligent creatures have a score of 3
* Any creature capable of understanding speech has a score of at least 4

Intelligence can be applied to any skill, however that is represented using skill points (Thus most skills aren't keyed of intelligence)

Zero Score {#int-zero}: A character with an Intelligence score of 0 is comatose.
Null Score {#int-null}: (Mindless) Have no modifier to any Intelligence-based checks. Usually Undead or Constructs

## Uses

* The number of skill points gained each level, though your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level.
* A wizard gains bonus spells based on his Intelligence score.
