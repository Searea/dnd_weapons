# Dexterity {#dex}

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is the most important one for rogues, but it's also useful for characters who wear light or medium armor or no armor at all. This ability is vital for characters seeking to excel with ranged weapons, such as the bow or sling.

Zero Score {#dex-zero}: A character with a Dexterity score of 0 is incapable of moving and is effectively immobile (but not unconscious).
Null Score {#dex-null}: Have no modifier to any Dexterity-based checks, always acts at initiative zero

You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:

* Ranged attack rolls, including those for attacks made with bows, crossbows, throwing axes, and many ranged spell attacks like scorching ray or searing light.
* Armor Class (AC), provided that the character can react to the attack.
* Reflex saving throws, for avoiding fireballs and other attacks that you can escape by moving quickly.

## Flat-Footed and Negative Dex {#dex-flatfooted}

Even people unaware of their enemies tend to be at least somewhat in motion (especially during combat). People with a low dexterity move less, and when they move, they move in a more rigid, predictable fashion (which is why you're easier to hit than average in normal combat and when you're not aware you're in combat).

Basically, being more movable than average does you no good when you're not actively avoiding something that tries to hit you (you're in motion, but the motion doesn't necessarily improve or decrease your changes of being hit because it's unrelated to being hit), while being less movable than average still harms you when you're not acively avoiding something that tries to hit you (you're still sluggish and predictable).

### Flatfooted is not the same as being motionless.

People unable to move (paralysed, asleep, unconscious, bound or in other ways helpless or rendered motionless) lose all their dexterity and are treated as if having Dex 0, which gives a -5 on AC.

Thus a guard who is ordered not to move a muscle while on guardduty (very common in royal guards, think buckingham palace) are treated as having Dex 0 when snuck up on, provided they're unaware of any enemies as they remain still
