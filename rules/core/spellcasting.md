## Difficulty Class (DC) {#spell-dc}

Spells follow the DC=`10 + SpellTier + AbilityScore` formula.
Abilities use the DC=`10 + Â½ CasterLevel + AbilityScore` formula instead

 * Which ends up much higher...
 * Needs to be lowered




## Familiarity

TODO: See Teleport spell for familiarity rules






## Touch Attack:

Holding the Charge

Missing an Attack does not use up the charge, you can try again later


Friendly Touch attacks: you can touch up to 3 willing targets as a single attack
 * Only matters if you hold the charge and need to touch others
 * If the spell lists a "Target" section you can perform the free touch attacks as normal
