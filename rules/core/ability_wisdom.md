# Wisdom {#wis}

Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, awareness, and intuition. While Intelligence represents oneâ€™s ability to analyze information, Wisdom being the represents to which you are 'attuned to your surroundings'.
Wisdom is suconcious intelligence and sensory awareness. It's your ability to spot things offhand, your clarity of thought and presence of mind, the accuracy of those "feelings" you get about people.

Wisdom save (Will) isn't your ability to resist, it's your ability to notice someone is messing with your head. It's your ability to go "hold on, I just met you!" When someone casts Charm Person, and the idea with these "subtle" enchantments is that once someone knows they're being messed with the spell is powerless. Wisdom is for mental effects that "mess with" your head, that an alert and attentive mind would notice and reject. Full on possession and other attempts to completely subsume one's will are Charisma saves.

Zero Score {#wis-zero}: A character with a Wisdom score of 0 is incapable of rational thought and is unconscious.
Null Score {#wis-null}: Every creature has a Wisdom score.

## Example Personalities

* Absent Minded Characters have *Low Wisdom* as they're likely to become highly focused, to the point of being completely oblivious and unlikely to notice peripheral sensory stimuli.
* Naive/Oblivious Characters have *Low Wisdom* as they won't notice anything different, and take longer to "catch on" to things

In practice Healing is all about the Wisdom. It's never as simple as applying what you learn in books to the actual act, it's so much about intuition and reading people, because often people won't even know what's really wrong with them, what's a symptom, what's a cause etc. Each person's body is unique and each person's health is effected by every act that they perform in their life. Total Wisdom skill.
