# Constitution {#con}

Constitution represents your character's health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points, so the ability is important for all classes.

Zero Score {#con-zero}: A character with a Constitution score of 0 is dead
Null Score {#con-null}: Have no modifier to any Constitution-based checks. Usually Undead or Constructs

You apply your character's Constitution modifier to:

* Each roll of a Hit Die (though a penalty can never drop a result below 1â€”that is, a character always gains at least 1 hit point each time he advances in level).
* Fortitude saving throws, for resisting poison, disease, and similar threats.
* !list_dex_skills!

If your constitution changes your hit points change accordingly.
