# Strength {#str}

Strength measures muscle and physical power. This ability is important for those who engage in hand-to-hand (or "melee") combat, such as fighters, monks, paladins, and some rangers. Strength also sets the maximum amount of weight your character can carry.

Zero Score {#str-zero}: A character with a Strength score of 0 is too weak to move in any way and is unconscious.
Null Score {#str-null}: Have no modifier to any Strength-based checks


You apply your character's Strength modifier to:

* Melee attack rolls.
* Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon
* Carry Capacity
* Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like).
* !list_str_skills!
