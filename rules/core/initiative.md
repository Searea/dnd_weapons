# Initiative {#initiative}

Initiative is used to resolve who goes first, or the order of player actions.

### Initiative Ties

In case of a tie, either character can act.
ONLY if one contests going second, do they need to resolve. The character with a higher base initiative bonus wins, if they're still tied roll an opposed initiative check.

### Standoff

If there is a standoff between parties that are aware of one another, then initiative isn't rolled until someone is ready to actually act. If initiative has already been rolled, but everyone is still delaying, or talking, initiative gets erased... and the groups are now in a standoff.

!alert! info
    Alternatively you can let the creature that actually breaks the standoff get a single action before initiative is rolled. Somecreatures might "be on edge" in which case they have a [Readied Action](combat:ready) that might kick off when this first character acts.
    Watch out! This can make intiative characters feel useless, as they can't use their skills to act first.
!endalert!

### Speeding up Initiative

Most initiative techniques involve counting down from the highest initiative until you hit a character. To speed it up the last character to go can count down out loud until a player speaks up "That one's Mine"





## Simple Initiative

The simplest initiative is used to resolve surprise actions.

All characters roll initiative (combine identical/similar monsters) then you count down from the highest initiative to determine order.



## Group Initiative

Players roll initiative like normal, but monsters roll one initiative. You resolve in the following manner: Fastest Players >> Monsters >> Remaining Players >> NEXT ROUND >> Monsters >> Players >> NEXT ROUND.

    Group initiative encourages players to not sit back waiting for everyone's turn to pass, because they go together in a group

## Round Based Initiative

Like Simple initiative, except you reroll at the end of each round. (A surprise round counts as part of the round following it, and doesn't prompt a reroll)



## Speed Factor Initiative

A creature gains a penalty to their initiative based on what they want to do. Only add the modifier for the *LOWEST* action a character takes.

 * DM Creatures can be grouped together, just use the slowest action out of the group, unless one of the creatures does something exceptional (going MUCH faster, or slower)

There are two versions of this initiatve, listed below

### Preround Version

Everyone must announce their actions at the beginning of the round, then everyone rolls adding their penalties.

1. Everyone must announce the what they're doing, they don't need specifics (like the target).
1. On your turn you perform your action as well as any movement as usual
1. If your turn comes up and you no longer need/can do what you wished, you can abort doing one of the following instead:
    * *Hustle*: Take an additional movement action, or simply perform a double move action
    * *Defend*: Use your action for Total Defense
    * Any other Purely defensive, or repositioning action
    * *Command*: Give orders to others (Handle Animal, Ride, etc)
    * *Aid Another*
1. Readied actions last from when you go this round, until the beginning of your turn next round
1. Taking a 1 round (or longer) action lasts from your initiative count until at least the same one next round. Aka it means you have a limit to your initiative roll next round. e.g. You start casting "Summon Monster" at Init:15, Next round you announce you're stabbing someone (with a dagger): you roll 18 (+4 init, +2 dagger) for a total of 26, but you're still casting "Summon Monster" until Init:15. Example 2: you instead roll a 1 for a total of 7, at Init:15 you finish casting "Summon Monster" (and can no longer be interrupted), but you don't get to go until Init:7 (including commanding the summoned creature)
1. Delay: floors your initiative to the next 5
1. Players are discouraged from sharing their result, and they shouldn't know what the enemies rolled... until someone hits their count

!spoiler! design
    Preround Speed Factor Initiative has one of the strongest effects on the game, and if done well can reduce "Analysis Paralysis" if the DM doesn't give players too much time. It can also lead to both tactical choices (based on action types) and more time resolving than planning the next turn.

    The most important part of this initiative is that you choose the target of your actions once you can actually go, this makes choosing what to do a little easier, making this fast to resolve when the DM puts you under the clock to choose.

    Tactically this also penalizes casters, if you know they're warming up a fireball it gives you time to scatter. The caster then needs to choose whether to reposition and save the spell slot, or fire it off less efficiently (Note: players should get a chance to roll Spellcraft to know what the opponent is using)

    This also makes the battle less like a chess game, players can't learn the order (it changes every round). This gives a frantic haphazard feel, as some of your actions become less useful, or your readied action helps out an ally.

    If players are good about not sharing their roll, then it also adds uncertainty... You know the enemy wizard is about to cast a Fireball, but not if one of you can make it in time (and you're firing an arrow right now)

### Postround Version

You intiative is affected by what you did last round, so slow actions penalize you in the following round.

!spoiler! design
    A fairly simple variation of Speed Factor Initiative, with decent tactical choices. Allowing a player to choose a faster action (but possibly less efficient) to go first the next round.

## Freeform (Reactive) Initiative {#initiative:freeform}

Anyone may go at any time (once a round), but anyone may choose to try to preempt them. Use a [reaction](action:reaction) to make an opposed check, anyone wanting to preempt, rolls together: The winner of this check gets to go before the originator.

To go a character just needs to announce their action (unless they won the opposed initiative check, where they can decide how to counter). They must know what they're doing, or else the lose the opportunity and someone else can announce their turn instead.

Some actions can even happen Simultaneously, e.g. two creatures attacking one another, where they don't need to preempt. In this case it is permissible to not consume a [reaction](action:reaction) as its assumed the result is the same regardless of the actual order of actions.

If someone needs to lookup a spell, feat, or ability they MIGHT be put on hold until they figure out how it works, allowing others to go first (Per the DM's Decision)
