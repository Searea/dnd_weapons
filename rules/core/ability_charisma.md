# Charisma {#cha}

Charisma measures a characterâ€™s force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to lead. This ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a social setting.
It's the amount of "presence" you have in a room just by being you, not your general likability (though a high Charisma character can often befriend others easier if they wish).

Charisma Saves are for True Willpower; Full on possession and other attempts to completely subsume one's will, such as Polymorph.

Charismatic characters are often good liars due to their air of confidence


Zero Score {#cha-zero}: A character with a Charisma score of 0 doesn't understand they exist, and is unable to exert themselves and is unconsious.
Null Score {#cha-null}: A creature without a Charisma score is unable to roll Charisma Checks, but defends as if it has no modifier.

You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:

* Checks that represent attempts to influence others.
* Channel energy DCs for clerics and paladins attempting to harm undead foes.
* Some Spellcasters use Cha to gain bonus Spells

## Example Personalities

* The Strict and Abrasive Military Commander has *High Charisma* you might hate them, but they're scary just to be around, and everyone will listen to them
* The Adorably Awkward Friend has *Low Charisma* they might be likable, but they're not confident, and their 'insecure' presence makes people less likely to listen to them or take them seriously.
* Shawn from Psyche has a *High Charisma* He commands people's attention even when being incredibly ridiculous. He shapes events around him with the force of his personality.
* Jayne from Firefly has a *Low Charisma* While he can intimidate when someone is tied up and he has a knife (obviously he's proficient in it), in general he isn't taken very seriously. No one doubts his skill with a weapon, or his readiness to kill. But he can't command a room no matter how hard he tries.
* A person with a malleable personality (conforming to people around them) has *High Charisma* if they're a social chameleon, retaining a strong sense of self, otherwise they have *Low Charisma* as they lose their self in the crowd

Charisma governs the ability to find and exploit a fear in the target.

    Intimidate has nothing to do with being scary. If you're scary, you're fuckin scary. If you just destroyed a brick wall with your fist, but then have a -2 to intimidate from your charisma mod, that doesn't mean people won't be scared.

    Intimidate is how scary you can make yourself without a demonstration of power. It represents how much people believe that you're going to carry through with the threats you make. It's your ability to look more dangerous than you actually are.

    If you just stabbed a guy in front of a crowd, no one is doubting your willingness to stab another. But if you walk up to someone you've never seen before and say, "let's take this outside.", intimidate determines how certain he is you're going to kick his ass.

    More importantly for intimidate, the skill isn't about seeming scary, after all your goal is usually to make someone tell you something useful. If you're just being big and scary they might just start crying and being utterly terrified of you, but they won't necessarily be telling you the information you want. If you're too scary they may just tell you anything to make you stop, give you what you want to hear instead of the truth.

    The intimidation skill is about scaring people in just the right way to achieve your goals, it's not about making people outright panic and fear for their lives. That's why charisma matters.

    Thus a powerful barbarian (with low charisma) might frighten a guard so much that he runs away screaming (alerting the whole guarded compound), a Charismatic Paladin would convince the guard (through fear) not to make a sound, or he'll lose his head.

    Nice, charming people intimidate because you look up to them, in my opinion. They have friends, sometimes your friends. Their opinions seem to matter more. Even if they don't come out and threaten you with physical violence, their potential for social retribution can scare your pants off. God forbid Tony, the guy who compliments you and makes everyone laugh, the guy who seems the life of the party, doesn't like you. He likes everyone, but you're such a dick for not doing that thing he wanted, that he doesn't like you. Even if he's too nice to say it, the others pick up on it. They know you're a bastard. He's so charming that, even if he's wrong, you want to believe he's right. Tony's charisma intimidates you because deep down, you've put him higher than you. Just like someone with hulking muscles or intense beauty. One could say the nice and charming guy is more intimidating, since his intimidation factor isn't superficial. He's right up there with the drill sergeant who can somehow inspire you by insulting you.

    Intimidation is getting someone to do something when you are gone because they fear you will do something to harm them. For example, being strong and frightening isn't enough to make a prisoner not attempt escape. Convincing them that attempting to escape will result in something worse than what they have now is what will keep them from attempting.

    Intimidation is about power over someone, not force.

    A character going insane caused a permanent penalty to wisdom and bonus to charisma. Insane people have strong personalities.

    Sentient Undead substitute charisma for constitution, as they're held together and kept "alive" by sheer will, whether their own or someone else's.

    The eldritch warlock- bargaining his soul for powers instead of loosing it, calling fiends and hellspawn to help him, radiating an aura of fear. Most notably, the warlock called in a demon/devil and bargained his soul for powers, whereas most people trying such things would become instantly possessed or worse, inviting all sorts of beings from an another plane just to help him to succeed in something and following blindly his orders, or just making his enemies afraid by his presence.

    If you have a player using a CHA dump stat, but they're asmooth-talker... then they might be trying to cheat the game (Talk to them)

    The combination of a character's low charisma and a player's silver tongue is "That sounded better in your head than it did out loud", as the character's words are filtered through low charisma and come out less effectively, perhaps they sound condescending, joking, or mumbles it so its barely audible.
