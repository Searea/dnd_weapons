## Cast Time

### Longer Casting Times
Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours.
When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action, you MUST spend your action each turn casting the spell (upkeep), and you MUST maintain your concentration while doing so.

The spell effect comes into play at the beginning of your turn AFTER the cast time

 * 2 Round Spell: First round is casting, Second round requires upkeep, beginning of third round it is cast

If you wish to abort casting the spell

Edge-Cases:

 * You can still perform Reactions while casting
 * You only provoke for the initial casting action, the remaining upkeep actions are concentration actions


## Target

### Willing

Willing targets are ones which concent to a spell being cast

 * Creatures are not given any information about a spell when they decide whether to consent, but can use Skills (Spellcraft, Sense Motive, etc) as normal to determine what they're consenting to
 * Changing your mind about being willing does not require an action, and can be done at anytime (even outside your turn)
   * THUS Longer duration spells which require a willing target can be dismissed by the target if they're no longer willing
 * By default a creature is assumed to be unwilling
 * Unaware (Unconsious, Petrified, Dead, etc) creatures are automatically Willing
 * Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation, Mental Control (Charm, Domination, Suggestion), can all make a target willing
 * Mindless creatures cannot be willing, unless they're under another's control (Who can then force them to be willing)
   * THUS Animated Objects, Undead, etc which are summoned/controlled by a spell can be made willing


## Mental

Mental Control spells have an edge-case where multiple effects might be stacking (multiple controllers)

 * Domination Spells
 * Suggestion Spells
 * Hypnotism Spells
 * Control Undead spells
 * Rebuke Undead (Turn Undead)
