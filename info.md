# Weapon Properties

Note: Properties marked: "Rare" are unlikely to be used often, so should not have a cost (work more as fluff, or maybe 1/4 cost)


Weapon groups have specializations, any qualities that fit cost 1/2
    Thus exotic weapons are either highly specialized, or mix into another weapon group
    Thus weapon upgrades usually go Basic >> Martial >> Exotic

    Give each group a “dice” range
    Masterwork weapons get an improvement in that specialty
    If its crosslisted in two categories:
        If there is a martial version, then thats probably the primary category
        If its double listed as martial, then either (or both)

Masterwork Weapon upgrades
    Masterwork Rank 1:   +1 to Hit
    Masterwork Rank 2:   Improve the specialty bonus

    https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Improved_Masterwork_(3.5e_Feat)

Crits change:

 * No need to confirm (Design: confirming always removed the excitement of a crit)
 * Basic crit now maximizes your weapon dice
    * Improved Crit == x2, x3 (rare)... which would maximize the base damage dice, and add more
    * Crit range is also stronger, so 20+, 19+, or 18+ (rare)
 * Exception: Vorpral, you still confirm (So its not a super-common effect)
 * Warning! Coup-de grace: usually does automatical critical damage
    * Scythe is usually a great combo with "Hold Person"
 * https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/critical-feats
 * Maybe remove crit range completely?
    * Only Keen would increase crit range?
    * Improved Crit lets you apply both the damage increase and the bonus action?
    * If there is no bonus action, (but the weapon category normally has one) you can choose to apply it now
    * IF there is no bonus action, and the weapon category doesn't have one... increase damage dice?


### TODO

Check that all maneuvers get something
And maybe some out of combat things too (skills)

Enough Basic Weapons?
Monk & Druid don’t need Basic Weapons category, but its still a valid choice?
Monk/Druid still have a reason to choose most categories (for their weapons…?)
    But they only need to specialize (Weapon Focus, Improved Crit, etc) with their entire weapon group?

No heavy damage focus (S/B/P) aka you need to spread yourself out a bit to get access to all damage types
    With some exceptions maybe (Close?)
Ranged has enough S/B/P choice


Purely “Exotic” things aren’t on the monk list
All Exotic categories offer a decent choice
All Damage types have a Finesse option


## Crit Properties

1. Crits should either be more common (higher range) but have a weaker effect. Or should be more rare but be stronger
2. Crits should be hard to optimized, there are few was to extend crit range
    1. Keen Weapons (Rare)
    2. Improved Crit (Weapon Category)


Maneuver on Crit:

 * Bull Rush
 * Trip
 * Shove / Reposition
 * Sunder
    * (Shield) Lance?

Special on Crit:

 * Feint

Damage Type on Crit

 * Energy

Condition (Energ Based?)

 * Bleed
 * Slowed

Feat Usage (or +x if you already have it)

## Offensive Properties

Brace: If you use a readied Action to set a brace weapon against a charge, you deal double Damage on a successful hit against a charging character (Includes str, feats, & weapon enhancement)
    (On the first hit only)
    Defensive Brace: +2 AC against an opponent you hit when bracing

Charging: Does double damage when charging (on the first hit with the weapon only)
    If you are using multiple weapons, they each would get one hit doubled

Brutal: Reroll any 1s on the base damage dice for this weapon
    Good for 2d6 vs brutal 1d12 (same avg)

Deadly: (rare) When you use this weapon to deliver a coup de grace, it gains a +4 bonus to damage when calculating the DC of the Fortitude saving throw to see whether the target of the coup de grace dies from the attack. The bonus is not added to the actual damage of the coup de grace attack.

Wounding: Every damage counts as 2 for the purposes of wounding

Hard-Hitting: (For Light weapons) This may be wielded in two hands for a 1.5 str bonus to damage



## Defensive

Block (X): Grants a +X shield bonus against the weapon type (unless flat-footed)
    Arrows (+bolts, darts, throw stones, etc), Light Thrown

Unbalancing (-X): Applies a -X (default -1) dodge Penalty AC while wielding one
    Warmace?


## Penalties

Slow Recovery: After making an attack with this weapon you take a -2 penalty to AC per attack

Weak: You do not add your str bonus to damage

Unwieldy: (rare?) used for 2H weapons which count as 1H for Str Bonus
    Finesse 2H such as Chains



## Weapon Types

Twin: The offhand counts as a light weapon for TWF if the weapon is wielded as a pair
    Kama, Butterfly swords

Uncomfortable: (rare) For weapons you wear, you cannot sleep in them without gaining exhaustion

Nonlethal (§): These weapons deal nonlethal Damage

Versatile: Increased damage when used 2 handed? (For most 1/2 handers), maybe call them 1½ handers
    https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Weapon#Versatile

Double: You can use a double weapon to fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You can choose to wield one end of a double weapon two-handed, but it cannot be used as a double weapon when wielded in this way—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

Light: Can be used for TWF

Limb: Is attached, Can hold another weapon, Can only be used if the relevant hand is free
    If it is magical and has weapon-like enhancements they only apply when actually wielding it (hand is free)
Attached: (rare) A weapon with the Attached quality grants a +4 weapon bonus to your Maneuver Defense to prevent you being disarmed. However, donning or removing an Attached weapon is a full round action.

Finesse (X): This weapon uses Dex instead of Str for toHit Rolls
    If there is a number listed, you need a minimum Dex; Otherwise you suffer an additional -4 Proficiency penalty
Finesse-able (X): This weapon can be used as a finesse weapon if the user desires
    If there is a Dex requirement, that is only when using it as a finesse weapon

Massive (X): This weapon has a minimum Str to use properly, suffering an additional -4 proficiency penalty if you do not meet it
    May never be wielded one-handed
    If the user is holding this weapon, and is surprised, they must still take a "draw weapon" action to use the weapon
    If the user has attached it to their back, then this weapon takes an extra move action to draw (Usually a full-round) and stow it
    Even if they have quickdraw that would only reduce it to the extra move action

Improvised Weapon: Things often used as weapons, but not made for this
    Always have a -4 proficiency penalty
    Usually 1d4, 20x2, 5ft range for thrown
    Usually filtered out of weapon lists

    Most weapons can be used in a strange manner as an improvised weapon (Shortened Polearms, Throwing strange Weapons)

Reach (Xft-Yft): Can attack and threaten the listed squares, if only one number is supplied, then it can only do so at that precise range.
    Unthreatening: This reach weapon does not threaten any squares it can reach, and its attacks are treated like a ranged attack.

Primitive: This weapon can be build with materials at hand, but it then gains the Fragile (1) Quality

Fragile (X): Cannot take the beating that sturdier weapons can. A fragile weapon gains the broken condition if the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with the weapon. If a fragile weapon is already broken, the roll of a natural 1 destroys it instead. Masterwork and magical fragile weapons lack these flaws unless otherwise noted in the item description.


Long: This weapon has trouble being used in confined spaces
    Longbows, longStaves, Polearms, Great weapons
    Efficient Quiver can store them
    Stick in the ground as a "Sheathe?"

    Note: this can be a very strong debuf... not sure if we want to use them
    But we may as well mark these as a reference

    Collapsable Pole (Mod)


## Maneuver

Hooked: A successful strike on an enemy allows you to perform a trip or drag maneuver as a swift action, treating this weapon as a trip/drag weapon for this attack.

Dismount (X): A mounted opponent hit by this weapon takes a –X penalty to Stay in Saddle
    Counts as a trip weapon for tripping a mounted opponent with a +X to trip
    (Default 2)

    Crit == free bullrush instead?

Grapple (X): Adds a bonus when grappling with this weapon
    Does not provoke an AoO when initiating a grapple
Locking: On a successful critical hit with a weapon of this type, you can attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple your opponent as a free action.
    This grapple attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature you are attempting to grapple if that creature is not threatening you.
    While you grapple the creature using a grappling weapon, you can only move or damage the creature on your turn. You are still considered grappled, though you do not have to be adjacent to the creature to continue the grapple. If you move far enough away that the creature you're grappling is no longer within the weapon's reach, you end the grapple with that action.

Distract (X): You gain a +X (Default +2) bonus on Bluff skill checks to feint or distract in combat

Trip (X): You can use a trip weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped. You do not provoke using a trip weapon. If there is a listed number (Default 0) you apply that bonus to trip attacks

    Some weapons aren't hidden, but concealed as something else
Stealthy (X): Attacking from stealth, the sniping penalty is reduced to by the listed number
    ? By Default this reduces the penalty from -20 to -10, however perhaps the penalty is already too high?

Performance: When wielding this weapon, if an attack or combat maneuver made with this weapon prompts a performance combat check, you gain a +2 bonus on that check.
    If used on a Perform(Wardance) or similar check you also gain the +2

Intimidating (X): Provides a +X (Default 2) toolkit bonus to intimidate checks
    Usually this applies only to demoralizing in combat


Monk: A monk weapon can be used by a monk to Perform a flurry of blows


## Ranged

Thrown: The wielder applies his Strength modifier to Damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons).
    It is possible to throw a weapon that isn't designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn't have a numeric entry in the Range column on Table: Weapons), and a character who does so takes a –4 Penalty on the Attack Roll.
        Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a Standard Action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a Full-Round Action.
        Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double Damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

___ Load: The weapon takes an action to reload between shots (the default is a Move action if unlisted)
Reloading is a AoO provoking action
    Bows, and most thrown weapons have an implied "Free Load" trait
Clip (X): The weapon has a clip of X shots before it needs to be reloaded
    Some of these weapons can have custom sized ammunition (bigger/larger clips) the number listed here is for the default clip
Belt: Requires an assistant, feeds a continuous stream of ammo
Cylinder: Holds X bullets, each one is reloaded as a separate action (revolvers), sometimes a speed loader can be used to reload all or part
Internal: Holds X bullets internally, each one is reloaded as a separate action (Shotguns), no speed loaders
Burst (X): When firing this weapon you expend the listed number of ammo, you can reroll one damage dice for each additional ammo you use for this attack.
    Special damage dice (not from the weapon, weapon properties, weapon enhancements, etc) cannot be rerolled
    If multiple burst numbers are listed, you can choose which burst mode to use e.g. (1, 3, 5)
    If multiple weapon fire types are listed, you can only choose one… if Burst(1) isn’t listed you cannot fire the weapon normally
Area Burst (X): The weapon is fired as a "spray and pray”, it targets an area doing Ref 1/2 damage to it
    Uses X ammo per shot (Default 1)
    Often used for Automatic Weapons
Noisy (X): Listen DC to hear the weapon being used is modified by the listed penalty (default -2)
Projectile / Ammo: A ranged weapon that uses projectiles
Subsonic:  Less damage (will be listed separately), but Listen DC is increased by 10 to hear the shot
    Decreases range increment by 20ft
Tracer: Any following attacks at the target for the round gain +1 Precision to Hit. Spot DC is decreased by 5
    Automatic weapons gain the bonus during the attack as well

Prone: (rare) This ranged weapon can be used while prone (usually for crossbows)
    Some Thrown? Shuriken, Daggers?
    Maybe shortbows?

Grenade: Uses the grenade weapon throwing Rules
Splash (Xft, Y): In addition to listed direct damage adjacent creatures within Xft (Default 5ft) take Y damage
    Some will have a Ref DC listed

Returning: On a miss at the end of your turn you can catch it if you have a free hand
    There must be no obstructions on its return path
Alt: A thrown weapon that returns to the wielder in a non-magical fashion, like a boomerang. To catch a returning weapon, the thrower must make an attack roll (as if he were throwing the weapon) to hit AC 10. Failure indicates that the weapon lands in a random square adjacent to the thrower (if proficient) or 1d4 squares away (if not proficient).

Mighty (X): Allows you to add your str bonus to damage up to the listed number
    However if for every point of might that you do not utilize in the bow you take a -2 penalty to Hit
    (Mighty +3 bow fired as a Str 13 (+1) means a +1 dmg, but -4 to hit)
    (Might +2 bow fired as a Str 18 (+4) means a +2 dmg, no penalties)

Powerful: Allows you to use str based feats (Such as Power attack) normally useable on melee only weapons.
    Allows you to use str for attack rolls
    Is treated like a large boulder for affect/feats/etc so Gust of Wind, Deflect Arrows, Wind Wall, etc






## Potential (But unused/unbalanced so far) Properties
Barbed: Do bonus Wounds
    OR AP (Unarmoured)
    Ravaging?
    Deadly?

Bashing: If the opponent is using a blade/blocking/parrying item, this weapon causes the limb to go numb on a successful strike.
    Fort ? or numb, cannot use the hand for 1 round
    All other limbs have similar penalties for the round, feet decrease land speed by 10'

Reposte: When fighting defensively, if an adjacent enemy misses you they provoke an AoO from you
    You can only do base weapon damage this way?

Defensive (X): When you use this weapon to fight defensively, you gain a +X (Default 1) dodge bonus to AC, double in Total Defence

Deflect: Techniques this weapon use involve blocking and weaving as much as they do attacking. When a creature damages you with a weapon attack while you are wielding this weapon, you may use your reaction to reduce the damage by your dexterity modifier. This property may be applied to piercing weapons as well.

Blocking (X): Uses durability to block, (Default x: All)
    1) You must be aware (not Flat-footed, conscious, etc) in relation to the attack
    2) Uses a Reaction (AoO)

    Any weapons with this property are crosslisted as shields, and count as a shield for feats

    Blades: Any bladed weapons: Spears, Swords (Curved or Straight)
    Arrows: Any similar projectiles: sling rocks, arros, bolts, darts, etc
        Only applies for projectiles up to 1 size larger
    Fire/Lightning: Blocks elemental attacks that normally require a Reflex Save, you can choose to block instead of rolling the save, this acts as if you rolled a pass on the save (for purposes of things like Evasion). Can also block damage of this type from any attack roll (e.g. you get attacked with a flame spear doing 1d4 fire + 1d4 Piercing, one use can block the fire damage only)

    All: Blocks any attack, most shields have this

    Feat: Increase uses of blocking by 1 (as if durability is 1 higher)
    Magic Items: Auto-Repair after an Encounter?







#---------------------------------------------------------------
# Weapon Specializations
General Ideas:

Specialized Counters:
    AP (Heavy & Med)
    AP (Shield)
        Note: this also bypasses "Blocking" weapons if they apply.
        Note: this also bypasses any active shield ability (Durability sacrificed for DR?)
    AP (Cover)
        Note if this removes the entire cover bonus, the creature is not considered to be in cover (for the sake of feats/abilities)
    AP (Unarmoured)? maybe "Wounding" only works vs unarmoured?

    Block Blades
    Block Arrows
    Block Thrown

    Break Shields
    Break Blades

    vs Mount (Dismouting, vs Charge)

    Durability reset daily?

# Considerations

Weapons have been basically split into: "dagger", "light", "Heavy" (1H), "Great" (2H)

Crit Range increases: 19+, 18+
Crit Multiplier: x3, x4
Crit Maneuver: Bull Rush, Trip, Disarm (Possibly with another bonus on this roll due to crit?)



There are a lot of things that make a weapon stronger.

Damage vs to Hit
Versatility (being able to do more with weapons)
AP
Reach vs Restrictive
~Damage Type
~Crit
Proficiency
    Simple
    Martial Groups
    Exotic Groups
    Racial (but can be taken as an exotic group if the wrong race)
    Druid, Monk (but not finesse), Elf, Dwarf, Gnome
    Note: Grant +2 weapon groups to everyone, and anyone who originally had 3+ groups can choose an exotic one to start
    Weapons in multiple categories?
    See: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/buildingCharacters/weaponGroupFeats.htm, Unearthed Arcana

Accessibility:
    Gold
    Skill (Simple, Martial, Exotic)… but what about weapon groups

    Remember some weapons will be easier to find, however most weapons in the original list should be fairly common
    Gold Costs too shouldn't affect balance, unless we're talking a couple 100gp...
    Most exotic weapons will by default cost more anyways
    Most "Strange" weapons will also cost more usually, being useful in rare circumstances


2H:
    Can use Spell Components
    More Damage
2H Bow + Buckler
    Can use Spell Components
    Slight Defence
    Arcane Penalty?
1.5H
    Can use Spell Components
    Can do more damage
    Can choose use skills, climb, torches, etc and still fight one handed
    (theres no more 1.5 handers? so just wielding a 1H as a 2H)
1H + Buckler
    Can use second Weapon
    Can use Spell Components
    Arcane Penalty?
1H + Light Shield
    Can use Spell Components
    More Armour
1H + Heavy Shield
    More Armour
1H + Blocking
    More Defence
    Can do more damage








## Extra Info

http://jackalmage.pbworks.com/w/page/6552473/WeaponConstruction

Notes:
 * Things that give you choice only matter if they're a valuable choice for 1 character
    e.g. Finesseable only makes the weapon a good choice for more characters... one PC would choice the best ability and stick with it (thus it isn't stronger)
     BUT Multiple damage types allow a single PC to bypass more DR, and mixed DR (Slashing & Bludgeoning) is super rare, so shouldn't be considered

Additions:

Damage Type:
 + 0.5  Can use multiple Damage types (AT ONCE)
 + 0.25  Can use multiple Damage types (by choice)
 + 0.5?  Non-Lethal

Maneuvers
 + 0.5   +2 to a Maneuver
 + 0.5   Charging
 + 0.5   Blocking (1 Charge)
 + .25   Blocking (Per extra use)

Weapon Type:
 + 0.25  Finesse, Finesseable
 + 1     Light
 + 0.5   Throwing
 + 0.5   Grappling (Non-Light)

Crit
 + 1     Crit Range
 + 1     Crit Damage
 + 0.5  Crit bonus action (Since it requires another roll, its not great)


Reach
 + 1      Extended (per 5ft donut)
 + 1      Full (damage adjacent too)
 - 0.5    Provoking
